# üìä Tekmetric Backend ServiceMonitor

This file defines a **Prometheus Operator ServiceMonitor** resource for scraping metrics from the Tekmetric backend service. It enables Prometheus to automatically discover and collect metrics from the backend‚Äôs `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint.

## üß† What Is a ServiceMonitor?

A **ServiceMonitor** is a custom resource (CRD) provided by the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator).  
It tells Prometheus **what services to monitor** and **how to scrape their metrics**.  

Without a ServiceMonitor, Prometheus would need manual configuration (via static scrape configs).  
With a ServiceMonitor, Prometheus dynamically discovers targets in Kubernetes based on **labels**.

**Installed automatically when deploying your backend via Helm**
